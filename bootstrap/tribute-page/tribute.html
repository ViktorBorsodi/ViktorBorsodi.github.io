						<h3>Here's a summary of Warren Buffett from Wikipedia:</h3>
						<p>Warren Edward Buffett (/ˈbʌfɪt/; born August 30, 1930) is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. Buffett serves as the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is considered by some to be one of the most successful investors
						in the world, and as of August 2017 is the second wealthiest person in the United States, and the fourth wealthiest in the world, with a total net worth of $81.1 billion.</p>
						<p>Born in Omaha, Buffett developed an interest in business and investing in his youth, eventually entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring and graduating from University of Nebraska–Lincoln at the
							age of 19. Buffett went on to enroll and graduate from Columbia University where he learned and eventually molded his investment philosophy around a concept pioneered by Benjamin Graham–value investing. He attended New York Institute of Finance
							to specialize his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one with Graham. After meeting Charlie Munger, Buffett created the Buffett Partnership. His firm would eventually acquire a textile manufacturing
						firm called Berkshire Hathaway and assume its name to create a diversified holding company.</p>
						<p>Buffett has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970, and his business exploits have had him referred to as the "Wizard", "Oracle" or "Sage" of Omaha by global media outlets. He is noted for his adherence to
						value investing and for his personal frugality despite his immense wealth.</p>
						<p>Buffett is a notable philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2009, with Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, Warren founded The Giving Pledge,
						whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>"The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market's fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin of safety. That's what Ben Graham taught us. A hundred years from now they will still be the cornerstones of
								investing."
